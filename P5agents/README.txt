Each Person's Responsibilities:
We worked on it altogether at the same time using paired programming, so the commits do not accurately represent what each person did since we all worked on it together.

Clarinda: Updated action classes to use new peasant class, updated createSepiaAction, debugged null pointer issue on large map (added new inner class HarvestType), and debugged issue with peasants not moving.
Veijay: Fixed preconditions in each Action class to account for multiple peasants, edited the heuristic, debugged problems with moves, and edited findBestResource.
Vishal: Reorgainzed generateChildren() in GameState, updated Peasant class field, updated preconditionsMet() in MoveKAction, and updated heuristic for building peasants.
