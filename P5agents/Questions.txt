Questions:

1. Does building a peasant cost 1 food? When we played the manual control, building a peasant added 1 food to our current food rather than deducting 1 food.

2. Are we supposed to build 3 peasants on the board (and not any more) if we can only execute 3 parallel actions at a time?

3. Are we limited to 3 parallel moves at a time?
